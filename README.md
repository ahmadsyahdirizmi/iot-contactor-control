# üîß IoT-Based Contactor Control System

## üéØ System Purpose
The IoT-Based Contactor Control System is designed to provide remote control and monitoring capabilities for industrial contactor panels. The system enables:

1. Remote control of contactors through mobile application
2. Real-time monitoring of contactor status
3. Automated scheduling of contactor operations
4. Integration with existing control systems without modification

### üí° Proposed Solution
To address the above requirements, the following solutions are implemented:

1. **Hardware:**
   - **Microcontroller:** ESP32 DevkitC V4, which supports Wi-Fi connectivity, controls relays to activate/deactivate the contactor, and supports external antennas for better Wi-Fi coverage.
   - **Sensors:** AC 220V voltage detectors to monitor contactor status.
2. **Relay Setup:**
   - Two relays (NO and NC) are used to control a single contactor, functioning like PB NO and PB NC on the panel.
   - The NC relay is connected in series with PB NC, and the NO relay is connected in parallel with PB NO.
3. **Mobile Application:**
   - Blynk Mobile App is used for IoT automation to schedule the contactor's operation.

  <em>Figure 1: Hardware System Workflow Diagram showing the operational sequence of the IoT Contactor Control System</em>
</p>

The workflow involves several processes, including:
1. Configuring the Wi-Fi connection.
2. Controlling relays to manage the contactor's status.
3. Monitoring the contactor's condition (on/off).

### üîå Component Functions:
- **ESP32 DevkitC V4:** Central controller for the system.
- **Relay NO (NO1-4):** Acts as the start push button on the panel.
- **Relay NC (NC1-4):** Acts as the stop push button on the panel.
- **Sensors (1-4):** Detects voltage on the LED indicator to determine the contactor's status.
- **RGB LED:** Indicates the system's status:
  - üî¥ **Red:** System is powered but not connected to Wi-Fi or server.
  - üîµ **Blue:** System is connected to Wi-Fi but not to the server.
  - üü¢ **Green:** System is connected to the server and operational.
  - ‚ö™ **White:** Wi-Fi Manager mode indicates the system cannot connect to the target Wi-Fi.
